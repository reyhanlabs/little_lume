  "chapters": [
    {
      "chapter": 1,
      "title": "Numbers & Counting",
      "listening": {
        "partA": [
          {

            "question": "How many apples are there?",
            "options": ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"],
            "answer": "B",
            "difficulty": "easy"
          },
          ...
        ],
        "partB": [
          {
            "id": "L1-B01",
            "question": "There are [BLANK] apples.",
            "answer": "two",
            "difficulty": "easy"
          },

      },
      "reading": { ... },
      "writing": { ... },
      "speaking": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

  "options": ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"],
  "answer": "B",
  "difficulty": "easy"
